# STAT946-Assignment2
uWaterloo Spring2020 STAT946 - Advance Bayesian Computing  

The `index.Rmd` file contains information about this assignment. I rendered it using `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd')`. A `HTML` file will be generated.  

Since the coding was done in Python, a notebook is also included in the repo to regenerate all the plots in the `Rmd`.
